# JsonJavaSample

Rudimentary implementation of Serializing/Deserializing JSON to a sample Java object and vice versa. The current implementation only allows writing/reading to a file.

# Getting Started

The program requires 2 parameters: 

`-i {binary value: 0 write JSON to file or 1 read the json to the Java model} -f {path-to-json-file}`

Save yourself some headache and dont try to compile and run via CLI. Use Intellij/Eclipse
